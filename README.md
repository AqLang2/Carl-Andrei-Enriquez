We created a program for the company so they can effcieintly manage sotcks and identify items that needs
to be refilled. The transcations such as their Purchases, Sales, Received Purchase are the main functionality we programmed. 
We also made an invetory master file which they can manipulate to input and remove their products that were added and removed.
